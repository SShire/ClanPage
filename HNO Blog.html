    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p><strong>You just entered our clan page!</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"></span><br>
    <br>
    HNO stands for the <strong>Hidden Night Owls</strong>. This clan is made up of 5 people known as Players of the Light. This
    beloved group of people have faded in and out of the connection because of life and education. But when it comes
    to free time, we try to make the most out of it. Either by playing Nightfalls, or just messing around in
    freeroam lobbies. Or just plain old crucible with everyone! Raids and longer missions tend to take long and
    sometimes it's frustrating to continue for a long time. We often give up, but that is not our longer mission as
    a clan. We were created to search and enjoy this beautiful game known as Destiny, together. We were meant to
    create our own journey, as Guardians.</p>
